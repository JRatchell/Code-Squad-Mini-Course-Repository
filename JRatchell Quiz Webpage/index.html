        <ul>
            <li>A. Because I felt like calling them that to mess with whoever is trying to legitimately take this quiz :)</li>
            <li>B. Because they are cards meant to be used <i>from your hand</i> during your opponents turn to disrupt their play</li>
            <li>C. Because the game has become so convoluted and needlessly verbose that the playerbase of this <b>"Children's card game"</b> are mostly fully grown adults </li>
        </ul>
        <li><p>When do you think was the last time that a card game player had seen the light of day?</p></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A. Back when hitting random objects with large sticks was considered "skillful" and a "national passtime" <del>(I mean it still is but you get the point)</li></del>
            <li>B. Just yesterday, card game players are actually capable of being well adjusted individuals who can balance their work and their hobbies well, contrary to the sterotype of the basement-dwelling nerd</li>
            <li>C. All the above, this entire section is just an excuse to poke fun at both myself and a hobby that I enjoy</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
